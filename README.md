# mypypong
My Python Pong game, a Breakout clone using Tkinter. Built and run on Python 3.5.

Possible future improvements:
* Make sure code is PEP8 compliant.
* Add sound. At least some pings and pongs.
* Improve key response. The keyboard delay is annoying, at best.
* Add tests that actually test. Current file structure is skeleton only.
